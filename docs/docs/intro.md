# Intro

Kimbia - A minimal cross-platform task runner.

Kimbia is swahili for "run".

Everything Kimbia does is defined in a `kimbia.yaml` file in the root of your project.

Kimbia is a task runner that is designed to be simple and easy to use.

When we refer to having documentation built-in,
we mean that you should be able to run `kimbia describe <task-name>` and
get a beautiful description of what the task does.

So there is no need to have a separate `README.md` file for that task.

We render markdown in the description of the task, in the terminal.

Everything Kimbia does, can be also achieved via npm- pwsh- or shell-scripts,
but Kimbia is designed to be simple, cross-platform and easy to use.

You can have the same task that does different things on different platforms and architectures.
